## Installation:
1. Install the Client Setup exe file found in Releases
2. Run it.
3. Click "More Info" when the popup appears
4. Click "Run anyway" (This does not mean the client is a virus it simply means I am not a known windows developer!
5. Then the client should run!)

If you have any questions, suggestions or any problems with the client you can contact me on discord: panda#2345
